                    <h2>About the Author</h2>
                    <p>Vilate 'ViLatte' Jules Knapp was born in Lodi, California in 2004. She since moved to Utah, Montana/North Dakota, and currently resides in Idaho. Although young, she has great ambitions and wants to use her language to connect to people who feel lost. As a young girl she enjoyed music, and still does, incorporating music into her poetry and vice versa. She is studying to become a software engineer. She enjoys logic and critical thinking, so she takes great pleasure in problem solving.</p>
                    <p>ViLatte grew up in a small town in the border of Montana and North Dakota. While living there, she learned to drive in the snow and to measure the rise and fall of the river waterline. She also learned the importance of taking part in a community and doing good for the sake of it.</p>
                    <p>ViLatte has always felt a connection to the ocean, even after living away from it for so many years. She is a Pisces, INFP-T, and 4w3. She has been writing since she was five years old and singing since even before that. She has a wild spirit and loves travel. She has said her heart belongs in Poland.</p>

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>Vilate started school at Naples Gradeschool in 2009. She only studied there for a brief time before transferring to Davis Elementary. From there she would pursue a long list of different schools. Notably: Creekview Elementary and Castle Heights. Eventually, she moved to Fairview West Schools and stayed in that area, progressing through Fairview Junior High and Fairview High School until her graduation in 2022.</p>
                    <p>Following her graduation, Vilate applied and was accepted into Brigham Young University - Idaho. She is currently working to receive her Bachelor's in Software Engineering with a minor in English. Eventually she hopes to work as a software developer and teach Polish students English as a second language in her spare time.</p>

                    <h2>Work</h2>
                    <p>Vilate began work in 2006 as a nanny of a younger brother. She continued to work in this position as an unpaid intern until 2016, when her skills began to be recognized in the field and she was promoted to a below-minimum-wage employee. By this point she was constantly nannying a minimum of four younger siblings. She contracted other positions as a babysitter, all which had varying levels of pay, sometimes none at all.</p>
                    <p>In early 2020, Vilate began work as an office cleaner, cleaning an oilfield office. The pay there was better but the conditions were almost insufferable. She spent many a night breathing in the cleaning fumes and wishing she were elsewhere. When her position there ended, however, she suddenly missed it.</p>
                    <p>In the Summer of 2021, from May to September, Vilate worked as both a lifeguard and swim instructor. She spent her mornings in the chlorinated water with young swimmers, and her afternoons protecting the people. In 2022, Vilate began work as a pizza artist for Papa Murphy's in Williston, North Dakota. She has continued at that position on-and-off while studying at BYU-I.</p>
                    <p>In the Summer of 2023, Vilate contracted to help Angel Studios by picking up work in their warehouse when they were overworked because of the massively successful release of <i>Sound of Freedom</i>.</p>
