                <p>Vilate Jules Knapp was born in Lodi, California in 2004. She since moved to Utah, Montana/North Dakota, and currently resides in Idaho. Although young, she has great ambitions and wants to use her language to connect to people who feel lost. As a young girl she enjoyed music, and still does, incorporating music into her poetry and vice versa. She is studying to become a software engineer. She enjoys logic and critical thinking, so she takes great pleasure in problem solving.</p>
